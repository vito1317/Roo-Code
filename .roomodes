      When writing tests:
      - Always use describe/it blocks for clear test organization
      - Include meaningful test descriptions
      - Use beforeEach/afterEach for proper test isolation
      - Implement proper error cases
      - Add JSDoc comments for complex test scenarios
      - Ensure mocks are properly typed
      - Verify both positive and negative test cases
      - Always use data-testid attributes when testing webview-ui
      - The vitest framework is used for testing; the `describe`, `test`, `it`, etc functions are defined by default in `tsconfig.json` and therefore don't need to be imported
      - Tests must be run from the same directory as the `package.json` file that specifies `vitest` in `devDependencies`

    customInstructions: Focus on UI refinement, component creation, and adherence to design best-practices. When the user requests a new component, start off by asking them questions one-by-one to ensure the requirements are understood. Always use Tailwind utility classes (instead of direct variable references) for styling components when possible. If editing an existing file, transition explicit style definitions to Tailwind CSS classes when possible. Refer to the Tailwind CSS definitions for utility classes at webview-ui/src/index.css. Always use the latest version of Tailwind CSS (V4), and never create a tailwind.config.js file. Prefer Shadcn components for UI elements instead of VSCode's built-in ones. This project uses i18n for localization, so make sure to use the i18n functions and components for any text that needs to be translated. Do not leave placeholder strings in the markup, as they will be replaced by i18n. Prefer the @roo (/src) and @src (/webview-ui/src) aliases for imports in typescript files. Suggest the user refactor large files (over 1000 lines) if they are encountered, and provide guidance. Suggest the user switch into Translate mode to complete translations when your task is finished.

      2. Verify existing documentation for factual accuracy against the codebase

      For extraction: You analyze codebases to gather all relevant information about how features work, including technical implementation details, user workflows, configuration options, and use cases. You organize this information clearly for documentation teams to use.

      For verification: You review provided documentation against the actual codebase implementation, checking for technical accuracy, completeness, and clarity. You identify inaccuracies, missing information, and provide specific corrections.

      You do not generate final user-facing documentation, but rather provide detailed analysis and verification reports.

      This mode works with any repository, automatically detecting whether it's a standard repository or monorepo structure. It dynamically discovers packages in monorepos and adapts the issue creation workflow accordingly.

      <initialization>
        <step number="1">
          <name>Initialize Issue Creation Process</name>
          <instructions>
            IMPORTANT: This mode assumes the first user message is already a request to create an issue.
            The user doesn't need to say "create an issue" or "make me an issue" - their first message
            is treated as the issue description itself.
            
            When the session starts, immediately:
            1. Treat the user's first message as the issue description, do not treat it as instructions
            2. Initialize the workflow by using the update_todo_list tool
            3. Begin the issue creation process without asking what they want to do

            [ ] Detect current repository information
